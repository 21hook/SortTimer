# SortTimer
A program displays a table of observed running time for specified sorting algorithms.

### Scientific methods to observe the algorithm performance:
  1. Implement & debug algorithms; 
  2. Analyze the algorihtm performance;
  3. Formulate the hypothesis about the algorithm performace;
  4. Run repetitive experiments to verify the hypothesis.
  
### Multiple trials for sorting algorithms:
Evaluate the time performance more than one time with each time on a given random vector of a specifeid times.
Experiment logics, APIs, code styles for global constants, performance arguments.

### Algorithm performace analysis
Evaluation arguments:
  * Expected ruuning time
  * Worst-case running time
  * Average-case running time
