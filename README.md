# SortTimer
A program displays a table of observed running time for specified sorting algorithms.

Scientific methods to observe the algorithm performance:
  1. Implement & debug algorithms;
 Â 2. Analyze the algorihtm performance;
  3. Formulate the hypothesis about the algorithm performace;
  4. Run repetitive experiments to verify the hypothesis.
